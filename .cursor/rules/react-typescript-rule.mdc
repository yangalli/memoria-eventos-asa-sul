# React Rule

## Module Pattern
- Purpose: Encapsulate code and avoid global scope pollution
- Use When: Organizing related functionality and maintaining privacy

## Observer Pattern
- Purpose: Enable one-to-many dependency relationships between objects
- Example: Event listeners, pub/sub systems
- Use When: Building event-driven features or state management

## Factory Pattern
- Purpose: Create objects without explicitly specifying their exact class
- Use When: Creating multiple variations of similar objects dynamically
